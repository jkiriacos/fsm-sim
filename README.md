### About The Project

This was my first attempt at creating a webapp and my first time utilizing React. There was definitely a steep learning curve to this, as I kind of was learning as I went. The site _definitely_ isn't pretty, but it functions well and the actual graph creating looks quite nice in my opinion. Overall, this was a fun project to make and a great exercise.
